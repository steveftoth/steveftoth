title: iOS as a primary OS
---


It's funny that iOS is as old as it is but still is not quite there as a primary OS for most people.  

The tools should have been here long ago but Apple decided that everything needs to be locked down and 
expensive.  I'm trying to use "[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)" on my iPad Pro to post this and sure it works.  Though I can't say that this experience is better than a normal command line + vi workflow.  Apple adding support for better keyboard, trackpad makes this feel like a normal laptop but the split screen multitasking when needing to look stuff up is kinda jaring to me still.  

I've started a learning rust project at [Oxidize-core](https://github.com/steveftoth/oxidize-core) to implement some of the basic Unix command line utilities like sort, echo, cat, etc.  Just to get an idea of how rust works.  I was also looking at using Rust as a webassembly language cause I've always wanted to use webassembly to build a product.  The future is definitly on the web browser, now and for the next forseeable future.
