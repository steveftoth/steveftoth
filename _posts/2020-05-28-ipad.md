title: iOS as a primary OS
---


It's funny that iOS is as old as it is but still is not quite there as a primary OS for most people.  
The tools should have been here long ago but Apple decided that everything needs to be locked down and 
expensive.  I'm trying to use "[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/)" on my iPad Pro to post this and sure it works.  Though I can't say that this experience is better than a normal command line + vi workflow.  Apple adding support for better keyboard, trackpad makes this feel like a normal laptop but the split screen multitasking when needing to look stuff up is kinda jaring to me still.
