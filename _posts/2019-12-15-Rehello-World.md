title: You're up and running!  (Part 2)
---

Well it's been almost a year since I forked this thing and haven't added ANY content to this site. So let's try again. More than anything I think that I need to start to write, write, write.  There are so many amazing people that I've found on Twitter, writers and bloggers who write all the time.  

This github system is simple and let's me actually keep the history of anything that I write.  One of the major problems I've ignored for years is that the things that I produce get locked into formats that I could never get it out again without some software that I don't have control over.  This used to be Microsoft Word but then with the proliferation of the web, it's been Google Docs, Facebook, etc.  
Even if you use their 'download' services you still need to transform the data. I should probably follow up with some reasearch on this but it does feel like your data might still be locked up. Comments on Docs in Google Docs is part of the content and this feature is not really avaliable in other programs so even if you move all the main content of the doc.  
There still exists this other layer that only really has a home in the original program.
